sps (SPS) :  Stored Procedures Service

When plan migrate our Enterprise Database to cloud database TiDB, We were blocked.
Root reason is not the big data , but, are many SP(stored procedures), which are key and complex.
So, firstly, jump to split these SP from database server to cloud service.

The project are our solution , key stack:
1. Spring Boot - great tools for cloud service
2. Drools - java script for biz rule and more powerful than SQL
3. MapReduce - apply to biz data flow
